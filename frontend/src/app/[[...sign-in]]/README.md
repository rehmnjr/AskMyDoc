# Catch-All Route for Clerk Authentication

This directory implements a catch-all route pattern (`[[...sign-in]]`) which is required for proper functioning of Clerk authentication components like `<SignUp/>` and `<SignIn/>`.

## Why This Is Needed

Clerk's authentication components require a catch-all route to handle various authentication paths and callbacks. Without this pattern, you'll encounter errors like:

```
Clerk: The <SignUp/> component is not configured correctly. The most likely reasons for this error are:

1. The "/" route is not a catch-all route.
It is recommended to convert this route to a catch-all route, eg: "//[[...rest]]/page.tsx".
```

## Implementation Details

- The double brackets in `[[...sign-in]]` make this parameter optional, so the route will match both `/` and any path under it
- The middleware.ts file has been updated to properly handle this catch-all route pattern
- The original page content has been moved to this directory's page.tsx file

Make sure your Clerk dashboard has the correct redirect URLs configured for your application domain.
