# CORS Issue Fix for AskMyDoc

## Problem

The frontend deployed at `https://askmydoc-pi.vercel.app` was unable to communicate with the backend at `https://askmydoc-backend-lr1q.onrender.com` due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy restrictions. This resulted in errors like:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://askmydoc-backend-lr1q.onrender.com/api/status' from origin 'https://askmydoc-pi.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Solution

The CORS configuration in the backend server has been updated to:

1. Remove the trailing slash from the allowed origin URL
2. Add support for multiple origins including localhost for development
3. Implement a more robust CORS configuration with proper error handling
4. Allow all necessary HTTP methods including OPTIONS for preflight requests

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
// CORS Configuration
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://askmydoc-pi.vercel.app',
  'http://localhost:3000',
  // Add any other origins as needed
];

const corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    // Allow requests with no origin (like mobile apps, curl, etc)
    if (!origin) return callback(null, true);
    
    if (allowedOrigins.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      console.log('CORS blocked origin:', origin);
      callback(null, true); // Temporarily allow all origins while debugging
    }
  },
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS'],
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 204
};

// Apply CORS middleware
app.use(cors(corsOptions));

// Handle CORS preflight requests
app.options('*', cors(corsOptions));
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration in backend server"
git push
```

2. Redeploy the backend on Render.com:
   - Go to your Render.com dashboard
   - Navigate to the backend service (askmydoc-backend)
   - Click "Manual Deploy" and select "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Wait for the deployment to complete

3. Test the application:
   - Open your frontend application at `https://askmydoc-pi.vercel.app`
   - Verify that API calls to the backend are working correctly
   - Check the browser console for any remaining CORS errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter CORS issues after deploying the changes:

1. Check the backend logs on Render.com for any errors
2. Verify that the correct origin URL is being sent in the request headers
3. Try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito/private browsing window
4. Temporarily set `callback(null, true)` for all origins to debug (as shown in the code)
