with creepy eyes and speaking in a mechanical voice pops into our head.\nI mean that's what we have been watching in television for years, isn't it?\nAnd to a certain degree we are right.\nTraditional robotics has been perceived by pop culture as an arena that creates humanlike machines to work for us as saviours and sometimes as super-villains bringing in a cascade of tyranny into the human world.\nHowever, real life robots aren't as humanlike as we want them to be, yet.\nThey are programmed in a specific way to only execute tasks that it has been programmed to perform.\nImagine a self-driving car that has been designed to drive you on its own according to where you instruct it to take you.\nNow for a traditional robot, the car is going to go through the exact road that it was programmed to select for a certain destination by its creators, possibly without the knowledge of traffic and cause accidents.\nHowever, a human driver would have chosen the shortest path or check which paths have the least traffic today and would be the most convenient path for that particular destination.\nThat is the exact humanlike creative thinking the traditional robots lack!\nThey are fixed in their own \"not so smart\" way and are largely dependent on the program they are built on and the instructions that they are being given.\nIf a certain instruction doesn't coincide with their program, the robot won't even be able to run, let alone going the extra step of being creative.\nThis is the limitation of traditional robots Artificial Intelligence is being developed to overcome.\nUnlike the conventional \"bips and bops\", a good Al will simulate the","metadata":{"source":"A_Brief_Introduction_To_AI.pdf","page":2}}],["2",{"pageContent":"complicated and intuitive sense of thinking and problem-solving abilities of the human mind.\nA Brief History of AI\nThe concept of Artificial Intelligence is not as modern as we think it is.\nThis traces back to as early as 1950 when Alan Turing invented the Turing test.\nThen the first chatbot computer program, ELIZA, was created in the 1960s.\n[1 IBM deep blue was a chess computer made in 1977 beat a world chess champion in two out of six games, one won by the champion and the other three games were draw.\n121 In 2011, Siri was announced as a digital assistant by Apple.\n[3] Elon Musk and some others founded OpenAI in 2015. 4 [5]\nArtificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\nUp until now in this article we were discussing about Artificial Intelligence as a process that is going to help machines achieve a humanlike mental behaviour.\nAl is a vast and growing field which also includes a lot more subfields like machine learning and deep learning and so on.\nMachine learning is in a nutshell the concept of computers learning to improve their predictions and creativity to resemble a humanlike thinking process using algorithms.\nMachine learning involves a number of learning processes such as:\nSupervised learning: Supervised learning is a process where our machines are designed to learn with the feeding of labelled data.\nIn this process our machine","metadata":{"source":"A_Brief_Introduction_To_AI.pdf","page":3}}],["3",{"pageContent":"is being trained by giving it access to a huge amount of data and training the machine to analyze it.\nFor instance, the machine is given a number of images of dogs taken from many different angles with colour variations, breeds and many more diversity.\nSo that, the machine learns to analyze data from these diverse images of dogs and the \"insight\" of machines keep increasing and soon the machine can predict if it's a dog from a whole different picture which was not even a part of the labelled data set of dog images the machine was fed earlier.\nUnsupervised learning: Contrary to the supervised learning, the unsupervised learning algorithms comprises analyzing unlabelled data i.e., in this case we are training the machine to analyze and learn from a series of data, the meaning of which is not apparently comprehendible by the human eyes.\nThe machine looks for patterns and draws conclusions on its own from the patterns of the data.\nImportant thing to remember that the dataset used in this instance is not labelled and the conclusions are drawn by the machines.\nReinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is a feedback dependent machine learning model.\nIn this process the machine is given a data and made to predict what the data was.\nIf the machine generates an inaccurate conclusion about the input data, the machine is given feedback about its incorrectness.\nFor example, if you give the machine an image of a basketball and it identifies the basketball as a tennis ball or something else, you give a negative feedback to the machine and eventually the machine learns to identify an image of a basketball on its own when it comes across a completely different picture of a basketball.\nMeaningful Compression\nStructure Discovery\nImage Classification\nCustomer Retention\nBig data Visualistaion\nDimensionality Rieduction\nFeature Elicitation\nIdenity Fraud

the other hand is the concept of computers simulating the process a human brain takes to analyze, think and learn.\nThe deep learning process involves something called a neural network as a part of the thinking process for an AI.\nIt takes an enormous amount of data to train deep learning and a considerably powerful computing device for such computation methods.\nAI at Work Today\namazon\nPhoto by Dan Seifert / The Verge\nThe most common examples of uses of Artificial Intelligence can be found today in smart personal assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\nPeople interact with these devices to command them on a daily basis and these devices use the commands as a part of their dataset to learn from.\nAnother known example of Artificial Intelligence is the use of algorithms in Netflix.\nNetflix provides very much accurate and relevant suggestions of movies, tv series from our data which is created every time we stream or click on something in Netflix.\nAs the dataset for these systems grows, their accuracy and precision increase as well.

Many existing jobs are becoming redefined and more specialized which is really important for the new world to prosper and advance.\nTowards Conclusion...\nThe growth of Artificial Intelligence in recent times has been exponential. We cannot even imagine how big and impactful Al is going to be in the near future and how drastically it is going to change and upgrade the world we live in today. There are a lot more to learn about AI and its rapidly growing applications in our life. I believe it would be wise to adapt to this changing world and acquire skills related to Artificial Intelligence and technology. Just like AI learns and develops, we should too - to make this world a better place.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/09/alan-turing-at-100/\n[2 https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/\n[3] https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/siri-google-now-and-cortana-how-\ndigital-assistants-predict-what-you-need-3671725.html\n[4 https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/\n[5]https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35082344\n[6 https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/10/27/\n","metadata":{"source":"A_Brief_Introduction_To_AI.pdf","page":6}}]]
